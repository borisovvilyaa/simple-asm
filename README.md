# Simple ASM Project

This is a simple project written in Assembly language.

## Getting Started

To start coding in ASM, you need to download two tools: NASM and GoLink. 

1. Download NASM from http://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/2.16.01/.
2. Download GoLink from http://www.godevtool.com/Golink.zip.

After downloading the tools, add them to the system path by following these steps:

1. Open System > Other Parameters > Environment Variables > Path.
2. Add the path to the folders containing NASM and GoLink.

## Compiling the Code

To compile the ASM code, you can use the `make.bat` file included in the project. Simply run the following command:

```bash
.\make.bat name.asm
```
Replace `name.asm` with the actual name of your ASM file.
Use command `/console`  if program is console app
