# Simple ASM Project

This is a simple project written in Assembly language.

## Getting Started NASM

To start coding in ASM, you need to download two tools: NASM and GoLink. 

1. Download NASM from http://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/2.16.01/.
2. Download GoLink from http://www.godevtool.com/Golink.zip.

After downloading the tools, add them to the system path by following these steps:

1. Open System > Other Parameters > Environment Variables > Path.
2. Add the path to the folders containing NASM and GoLink.

## Compiling the Code

To compile the ASM code, you can use the `make.bat` file included in the project. Simply run the following command:

```bash
.\make.bat name.asm
```
Replace `name.asm` with the actual name of your ASM file.

5. print in cmd command ".\makeit.bat"
if all ok, displays the text that the file does not see us
6. copy test file example program http://blogs.kpi.kharkov.ua/v2/asm/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2020/08/LR1-64s-1.zip
